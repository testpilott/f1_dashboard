All notable changes to this project are documented here.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **Driver season dialog crash** — Opening a driver from the standings threw `can't access property "rows", d.summary is undefined`. The `/api/driver-season` route read snapshot key `driver-seasons-{id}`, but that file held a season-year list (`{ seasons: [...] }`, the `driver-career` payload) instead of the `{ season, driverId, summary }` shape the route and `DriverSeasonDialog` expect. The route now reads `driver-season-{season}-{id}`, and `tools/snapshot-weekly.ts` writes a correctly-shaped `driver-season-current-{id}.json` snapshot.

### Changed
- **`tools/snapshot-weekly.ts`** — Fetches current-season race results once and writes a per-driver `driver-season-current-{id}.json` summary snapshot (skipped if the fetch fails, to avoid clobbering a good snapshot with empty data)
- **`src/lib/snapshots/types.ts`** — Added `DriverSeasonSnapshot`; removed the now-unused `DriverSeasonsSnapshot`

### Removed
- **Stale snapshots** — Deleted the wrong-shaped `driver-seasons-antonelli.json` / `driver-seasons-russell.json`; the route falls through to live fetch until the weekly cron regenerates correctly-shaped files

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-01

### Added
- **Design token system** — OKLCH-based tokens in `globals.css` (`--surface-2`, `--surface-3`, `--primary`, `--muted-foreground`, `--grid-line`, etc.) powering dark-first theming
- **`src/lib/charts/theme.ts`** — `nivoTheme()` and `chartColors()` read CSS vars at runtime; single source of truth for all chart styling
- **`fetchWithTimeout`** — `src/lib/api/fetchWithTimeout.ts` wraps `fetch()` with an 8 s `AbortController` timeout; wired into jolpica, OpenF1, and Open-Meteo fetchers
- **`VALID_VIEW` validator** — Added to `src/lib/validators.ts` for the schedule route `view` param; tested in the validation suite
- **Rate limiting on schedule + logo routes** — Previously unprotected routes now use `rateLimited()`
- **Full jsdom test suite** — 172 tests across 21 files covering all pages and client components
- **Race detail test** — `src/components/race/__tests__/RaceDetailClient.test.tsx`
- **Projections page test** — `src/app/projections/__tests__/ProjectionsPage.test.tsx`
- **Compare page test** — `src/app/compare/__tests__/ComparePage.test.tsx`
- **`fetchWithTimeout` test** — `src/lib/api/__tests__/fetchWithTimeout.test.ts`

### Changed
- **LapChart** — Migrated from `recharts` to `@nivo/line`; removed `recharts` dependency entirely
- **All UI components & pages** — Fully tokenized: no hardcoded `zinc-*` or `#RRGGBB` values in JSX; all colors use design tokens
- **`error.tsx` + `ErrorBoundary.tsx`** — Tokenized to use `text-foreground`, `text-muted-foreground`, `bg-primary`, `text-primary-foreground`
- **CSP** — Removed `https://upload.wikimedia.org` from `img-src`; tightened to only allow `https://media.formula1.com`
- **`images.remotePatterns`** — Removed wikimedia entry (no longer used)
- **Vitest coverage thresholds** — Raised from 70% to lines/statements/functions 80%, branches 75%
- **README** — Fully rewritten with accurate stack, features, and security notes
